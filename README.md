## Developer experience

### Automatic code formatting

[Prettier][] is an opinionated code formatter aiming to provide codebase consistency when multiple developers work on the same project. The main reason behind adopting it is to [stop all the on-going debates over coding styles][].

### Static type checking

[TypeScript][] adds optional types to JavaScript, preventing several programming mistakes. For a quick guide about using React with it, please refer to the [React TypeScript Cheatsheet].

### Linting

Linters are tools that analyze source code to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs. Source code is linted by [ESLint][], enforcing the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide][] through an overridable set of rules provided by [eslint-config-airbnb][].
